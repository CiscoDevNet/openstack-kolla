# Step 5. Deploy your first VM within OpenStack

Within the Horizon UI, select “Compute->Instances”, then click on the “Launch Instance” button:

NOTE: If you don’t’ see the “Launch Instance” button, make sure you are in the “Project” section of the left side menu, not the “Admin” section.

1. Fill in the instance name (e.g. demo), then click "Next"

It may take a minute or two for the VM to start. Once complete, the “Power State” will switch from “Spawning” to “Active”.

Once “Active”, you click on the Instance Name of your new instance to see all the details about it, and you can select the “Console” tab to login to your VM.

The default credentials are generally noted in the VM when it first starts:

* username: cirros
* password: cubswin:)
