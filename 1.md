# OpenStack Containerized Deployment using Kolla

This learning lab gets you started using OpenStack deployed within containers. OpenStack Kolla provides production ready tools to deploy OpenStack services as Docker containers that can be managed and upgraded using Ansible playbooks. The lab makes use of an OpenStack deployment running within a DevNet SandBox. 
If you prefer to install and run everything on your own machine, complete the steps in "**How to Setup Your Own Computer**" prior to proceeding with **Step 1**.


## Learning Objectives

Completion Time: 45 minutes

* Use OpenStack within containers deployed using OpenStack Kolla
* Familiarize yourself with Horizon, the OpenStack UI
* Learn how to use the CLI, gaining a peak at OpenStack's programatic interfaces


## Prerequisites

**Background**

* We recommend you have a general understanding of what OpenStack is and are familiar with the goals of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openstack.org/software">OpenStack project</a> before you start this lab.


## Step 1. Create Network Adaptors within VirtualBox

For this lab, you need a NAT adaptor and two Host-only adaptors.

* The Host-only adapter allows the networking to be contained within the laptop and communicate with the host machine itself.
* The NAT adapter allows instances to connect to the outside world.

Verify these network adaptors exist, and create/edit them if necessary.

* Start VirtualBox (see "**How to Setup Your Computer**" at the top of this page if you need to install VirtualBox)
* From the system level, select the "VirtualBox -> Preferences“ menu option within VirtualBox, then click on the "Network" tab (examples for Mac, PC should be similar):

This adapter should be configured as follows:



* Base address of 10.100.100.0/24, this being the default NAT network.

Make sure the "Enable Network" box is checked and check the Supports DHCP Network Options box. Click on "OK" to save any changes.

**Host-only Networks** 

Select the "Host-Only Networks" tab

You can select “vboxnet0” to see the network details.
This adaptor should be configured as follows: 

* Enter 10.200.200.1 for the IPv4 Address on the Adapter tab
* Enter 255.255.255.0 for the IPv4 Network Mask on the Adapter tab

* Check the Enable Server box on the DHCP Server tab
* Enter 10.200.200.5 as the Server Address on the DHCP Server tab
* Enter 255.255.255.0 as the Server Mask on the DHCP Server tab
* Enter 10.200.200.50 as the Lower Address Bound on the DHCP Server tab
* Enter 10.200.200.200 as the Upper Address Bound on the DHCP Server tab
* Select OK

Next, select “vboxnet1” to see the network details.
This adaptor should be configured as follows: 

* Enter 192.168.57.1 for the IPv4 Address on the Adapter tab
* Enter 255.255.255.0 for the IPv4 Network Mask on the Adapter tab

* Clear the Enable Server box on the DHCP Server tab
* Leave all other fields on the DHCP Server tab empty
* Select OK
