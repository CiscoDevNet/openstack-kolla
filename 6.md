# Step 6. Using the OpenStack CLI

It should also be possible to SSH to the VM itself to get access to the local set of CLI tools (and the configuration files and application components.). 

CLI access is restricted to the admin; however, once within the CLI you can execute OpenStack CLI command as either admin or another user (note use of the "openrc" file later in this step).

Let’s use the CLI to launch a second VM (e.g. cli_vm).
To access the CLI (you can do this either from a terminal on your laptop or via the graphical interface of the VM itself):

```bash
ssh osdev@10.200.200.10		# password Cisco!Devnet
source ./openrc           	# configures access to CLI as demo
nova boot --flavor m1.tiny --image cirros --nic net-name=private_network cli_vm	#launch VM
```
This should result in a second VM, named “cli_vm” being started, and output similar to the following in the CLI:

The OpenStack component used to launch the VM was “nova”. The OpenStack component used to interact with the network is “neutron”. From the CLI, to see the same public and public networks we saw previously via the Horizon UI, use the command “neutron net-list”.

```bash
neutron net-list
```

As promised previously, let's have a look where the credentials we have been using are stored.

```bash
cat /home/osdev/openrc
```

To see the docker containers that are running, execute the command:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

To get into any container and inspect, execute the command:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> bash
```

For example, to enter the Nova compute container, execute the following command:
```bash
docker exec -it nova_compute bash
```

The configuration for OpenStack components can generally be found at "/etc/< component-name >/< component-name >.conf" (e.g. /etc/nova/nova.conf).

```bash
cat /etc/nova/nova.conf | more
```

Note the location of the log file is specified in this file as well (e.g. log_dir =/var/log/kolla/nova).
So to see Nova compute logs inside the nova compute container, execute the following command:
```bash
tail -n 100 /var/log/kolla/nova/nova-compute.log
```

To exit the Nova compute container, type exit

```bash
exit
```
 
#### Kolla First steps

The OpenStack environment running in the VM was built and deployed using Kolla. To see the Kolla code, log into the VM as the osdev user (password Cisco!Devnet). ~vagrant/kolla is the git checkout of the kolla code used to build the Docker containers in which OpenStack is running (Note: use sudo to cd into the directory if there are permission issues). ~vagrant/kolla/tools has various utilities which can be used to bring down, remove, rebuild, or redeploy the Docker containers which deliver OpenStack. In addition, there is a Docker registry running on the VM (on TCP port 4000) which is used to store the built Docker containers. /etc/kolla has the configuration files which were used to configure Kolla and the OpenStack services delivered by Kolla. You have full root level access so can further configure and explore as needed for your purposes.

VirtualBox was selected for this demo because it is freely available and provides good cross-platform support. Because VirtualBox does not support nested virtualization Kolla has already been configured to use QEMU without KVM when bringing up VMs in the OpenStack cloud running inside of VirtualBox. This will impose a performance impact in comparison to using KVM-accelerated QEMU as is more typical with OpenStack, but the OpenStack guest VMs should still be performant enough to use for experimentation and learning.

That concludes this lab. You have completed the installation of OpenStack, including verifying access and exploring a bit using both the Horizon UI and the CLI. 

### Welcome to OpenStack. Now feel free to explore on your own!
