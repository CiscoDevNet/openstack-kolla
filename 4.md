# Step 4. Power On

Select “Start” from the VirtualBox menu to power on the VM.

Once it boots you can login to the console window with the credentials:

* Username: osdev
* Password: Cisco!Devnet

You can now access the terminal.

Open a web browser and access the OpenStack dashboard (a.k.a. Horizon UI) at: <a target="_blank" href="http://10.200.200.10/">http://10.200.200.10/</a>

* Domain:   default
* Username: admin
* Password: password

These credentials have been preloaded and the system should log you in directly. 

* The credentials are specified in /home/osdev/openrc. We wil come back to this later.

Assuming you entered the credentials correctly, you should now be logged into your own OpenStack cloud as the cloud administrator.

If you select "Project", and then "Network->Network Topology", you should see a public network, a private network for the admin user, and a router providing access between the two.

Click on the router icon to see additional information about the router. The router connects the public network to the private network. Note the router has been assigned IP address 10.10.0.1.

Next click on the private network to see additional information about it. Note it has been assigned the address space 10.10.0.0/24 and its Gateway IP is set to that of the router we just explored (i.e. 10.10.0.1).

### Troubleshooting

What if I am not able to access the Horizon UI?

* If you were able to access but your credentials were rejected on login, double check the credentials and try logging in again.
* If not able to access the Horizon UI at all from your browser (e.g. the page times out or is not found), it may be that you are running a VPN on your computer and the VPN interferes with the routing necessary to access your local OpenStack environment. If this is the case:
	* Power off the VM
	* Restart your computer (disable any VPN)
	* Launch VirtualBox
	* Start the ciscolive_kolla_mitaka VM again
	* Retry accessing the Horizon UI
